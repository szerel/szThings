message = """👋🏻 Hello friend, Welcome to the "szThings" website!

☺️ I am glad to welcome you after successful registration.
📨 szThings is a web version of a problem book created using the Django framework. Here you can get acquainted with my work and learn about the features of this project.

The main feature of the site is saving your tasks. This will allow you to organize and manage your time effectively.

☝🏻Particular attention should be paid to the “Inbox” project. Here are collected tasks that did not find their place in other projects. This is a kind of buffer where you can store ideas and tasks, which can then be organized into categories.

For example, your projects may be related to:
- sport 🏈
- business 👩‍💼
- movies 🍿
- atmospheric evening 💕
- and this is only a small part that you can think of.

To do this, the site has functionality for creating your own organization menus, where you can create the above categories, or come up with something of your own

I hope that the site will become a reliable assistant in your work and time management. Enjoy your use and success in achieving your goals!

I love YOU 🖤
Thanks 🎉"""
